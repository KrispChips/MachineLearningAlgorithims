# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms coded from scratch in Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms by building them without relying on external libraries.

## Algorithms Implemented

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Perceptron
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Assembly AI's Maching Learning Algorithim Playlsit](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcWfeUsAys2k_xub3mHks85sBHZvg24Jd&si=G0OUM4R0xicLCImq) for acting as a guide and helping me code these algorithims from scratch.

### Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrispChips/MachineLearningAlgorithmsScratch.git
cd MachineLearningAlgorithmsScratch
```

To install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Every directory has the algorithm coded from scratch along with a train file to test it out!
To test out each algorithm make sure to cd into the algorithm and run the train file as such:

```bash
cd 'algorithm'
python train'algorithm'
```
replace 'algorithm' with the desired one such as KNN.

### Contributing
